## Accessing a form

One of the key features of Harness V2 is the ability to store any safety-related forms your company might need. These forms are fully customizable, and can include a wide range of information fields.

To fill out a new Workplace Inspection form, for example, first click the Forms icon in the navigation bar:

</p>

Once you are on the Forms page, select the form you want to work with from the dropdown menu near the top of the page:

</p>

The Search & Filter feature allows you to search by project name, project dates, and who submitted the form.

Entries of the form that fit your filter criteria will display below the Search & Filter bar.

## Adding a new entry

When you are ready to add a new entry, click on the yellow circle with the gray plus symbol on the navigation bar:

</p>

The fields marked with an asterisk (\*) are required.

Once you fill out the fields you need on a page, you can click on Next to go to the following page, or click on Jump To Section to see and navigate to all available sections of the form:

<p align="center">

</p>

The Jump To Section feature comes with a search bar for when you need to find a specific section.

## Submitting a new form

Once you have filled out all the sections you need, click on the Submit button at the bottom of the last page of the form.

You will see a green pop-up window on the top right-hand corner of the screen that confirms your entry has been submitted.

</p>

All new entries are first saved as drafts, which can be found under the Drafts tab.

It can take a few minutes for the app to save your entry to the database and to display it on the Forms page. If you are offline when you click submit, the entry will be saved under the Drafts tab until you are connected to the internet.
